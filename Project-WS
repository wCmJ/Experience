HTTP(hypertext transfer procotol) is an asymmetric request-response client-server protocol as illustrated.
    An HTTP client sends a request message to an HTTP server.
    The server, in turn, returns a response message.
HTTP is a stateless protocol. In other words, the current request does not know what has been done in the previous requests.
HTTP permits negotiating of data type and representation, so as to allow systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.


URL(Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL is used to uniquely identify a resource over the web. URL has the following syntax:
protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name
1.Protocol: the application-level protocol used by the client and server, e.g., HTTP, FTP, and telnet.
2.Hostname: The DNS domain name(e.g., www.nowhere123.com) or IP address(e.g., 192.128.1.2) of the server
3.Port: the TCP port number that the server is listening for incoming requests from the clients. default number of tcp port for http is 80
4.Path-and-file-name: the name and locatioin of the requested resource, under the server document base directory.
some examples of URL are:
ftp://www.ftp.org/docs/test.txt
mailto:user@test101.com
news:soc.culture.Singapore
telnet://www.nowhere123.com/


HTTP protocol:
Browser translates the URL into a request message according to the specified protocol. Browser sends the request message to the server.
EXAMPLE:
begin:
      http://www.nowhere123.com/doc/index.html will be translated to:
      GET /docs/index.html HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.nowhere123.com
      Accept: image/gif,image/jpeg, */*
      Accept-language: en-us
      Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
      User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
reach:
      when this request message reaches the server, the server can take either one of these actions:
      1.the server interprets the request received, maps the request into a file under the server's document directory, and returns the file requested to the client.
      2.the server interprets the request received, maps the request into a program kept in the server, executes the program, and returns the output of the program to the client.
      3.the request cannot be satisfied, the server returns an error message.
return:
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
